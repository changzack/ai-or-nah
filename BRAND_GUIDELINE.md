## Visual Language

### Sticker System

Scattered decorative elements that add personality and playfulness. Use sparingly — they're seasoning, not the main dish.

**Core Stickers:**
- 👁️ — detection/watching
- ✨ — magic/AI
- 🔍 — investigation
- ✅ — verified/safe
- 🚩 — red flag/warning
- 🤖 — AI/bot
- 🎭 — fake/mask
- ⚡ — fast/instant
- 💫 — sparkle/trust

**Usage Rules:**
- Rotate stickers 5-15° for organic feel
- Vary sizes (small accents vs. featured)
- Layer on top of photos and cards
- Max 3-5 stickers visible per section

### Photography Style

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Real, candid moments | Overly polished stock photos |
| Diverse, authentic people | Perfect "influencer" aesthetic |
| Slightly grainy/film quality | Hyper-sharp commercial look |
| Natural lighting | Heavy studio lighting |
| Behind-the-scenes vibes | Corporate headshots |

### Illustration Style

- **Line weight:** 2-3px, slightly wobbly/hand-drawn feel
- **Corners:** Rounded (8-16px radius)
- **Style:** Flat with subtle shadows, not 3D
- **Motion:** Subtle bounce/wiggle animations

### Phone Mockups

- Show real app interface inside device frames
- Slight rotation (2-5°) for dynamic feel
- Drop shadow: soft, warm-toned
- Can overlap other elements

---

## Layout Principles

### Grid System

- **Desktop:** 12-column grid, generous gutters (32-48px)
- **Mobile:** 4-column grid, 16-24px margins
- **Max content width:** 1200px

### Spacing Scale

```
xs:  8px
sm:  16px
md:  24px
lg:  48px
xl:  80px
xxl: 120px
```

### Composition Rules

1. **Asymmetry over rigid grids** — elements should feel placed, not forced
2. **Generous whitespace** — let content breathe on warm cream background
3. **Layering is encouraged** — stickers over photos, cards overlapping
4. **Full-bleed moments** — photo sections can break out of containers
5. **Horizontal scrollers** — for testimonials, detected fakes gallery
